# Crypto-Clustering
Module 19 Challenge - Clustering

In this challenge, youâ€™ll use your knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour, 7-day or 30d price changes.

Instructions:
1. Load the crypto_market_data.csv into data frame and get the summary statistics.
2. Prepare and normalise the data by StandardScaler(), setting coin_id as index.
3. Find the best value for k using original scaled data frame.
4. Cluster the data with k-means using the scaled data.
5. Create scatter plot to visualise the clusters.
6. Find and optimise the best value for k using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
7. Cluster the data with k-means using PCA.
8. Create PCA scatter plot to visualise the clusters.
9. Compare and analyse the results.
